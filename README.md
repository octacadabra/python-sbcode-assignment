# sbcode-python-assignment
I enrolled this bootcamp for a month, October last year. 
I've learned so much from this bootcamp, about Python for data science.

**Week 1**
1. Function, method
2. Comparison operator, boolean comparison, if-else statement, comparison operator with function, while loop, for loop
3. List, nested list, subsetting list, ordered list, max value, list operation, list manipulation, delete element list, list comprehesion, dictionary, adding new key-value, update & remove dictionary, nested dictionary, loop dictionary, remove duplicate list
4. Create simple chatbot
5. Descriptive statistics: law of large numbers, descripsive statistics value and/or using scipy (mean, mode, variance, median, std deviation, skewness, percentile, range, covariance, correlation coefficient, p-value)

**Week 2**
1. Pandas Introduction
    * creating dataframes object
    * read data from file
    * dataframe vs series
    * simple data checking (slicing)
    * statistics descriptive
2. Indexing, filtering dataframe with boolean, data transformation (normalization)
3. Reshaping Data
    * pivoting and melting
    * data structure comprehension
    * pivoting and aggregating
4. Grouping data: grouping all column, grouping some column based on multiple criteria, groupby multiple aggregate based on multipled criteria, groupby with different aggregation for specific column, groupby with custom function
5. Merging dataframe

**Week 3**
1. Matplotlib introduction
    * create axis and figure component
    * add multiple data into one axis
2. Custom visualization (color, linestyle, label, legend)
3. Multiple plots (nested axis)
4. Quantitative comparison 
    * visualization using scatter plot (change data type, replace na value, colormap, color, size)
    * preparing data (grouping, mean by category)
    * visualization using bar plot (grouping by category)
    * visualization using bar plot (stack bar plot)
5. Seaborn introduction (scatter plot, facet grid, pair plot, joint plot)

**Week 4**
1. Machine learning comprehension (what is machine learning, data feature & data target, supervised learning & unsupervised learning, classification & regression, hyperparameter & parameter), create model and prediction (sklearn, decisiontreeregressor, tree)
3. Univariate, Bivariate, Multivariate Analysis
    * Algorithm comprehension
    * KNN algorithm (create model, training, prediction, accuracy checking, ploting using lineplot)
    * Linear regression model application
4. Machine learning (unsupervised, clustering)
    * Model evaluation comprehension (training data, validation data, test data, assess performance, confusion matrix, classification report from sklearn)
    * Model evaluation application
    * Model selection comprehension (bias & variance, overfitting & underfitting, set model complexity, gridsearchcv & randomizedsearchcv)
    * Model selection aaplication 

**Week 3 Quiz**
1. Column split
2. Dataframe merging
3. Sorting & filtering
4. Data binning, grouping, and aggregating 
5. Bar plot 
6. Scatter plot
